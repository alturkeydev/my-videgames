# my-videogames

Dear Human,

This repo includes the best video games I developed. Please, honor me and have a look. Don't worry, they are standalone executables, so you won't have to install anything. Most of them were developed using GameMaker Studio using GMX which is based on Java.

Have fun,

Younes
